# Security review - 0.4.0

| | |
|---|---|
| Subject | `ykush3cmd` after the HID transport moved from `hidapi` to `async-hid` |
| State | commit `26e550e`; the working tree carries documentation changes only |
| Scope | `src/`, `tests/`, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `deny.toml`, and the patched `async-hid` the build resolves to |
| Date | 2026-09-24 |
| Method | reading the transport and protocol layers along the categories below, reading the IOKit backend of the dependency, `cargo deny check`, `cargo test`, and an attempt to build the package from a bare clone |

[SECURITY-REVIEW.md](SECURITY-REVIEW.md) covers the state before that move, when the only
dependency was `hidapi 2.6.6`. It is correct for what it reviewed and is left as it stands.
Where the two disagree, this one is current.

**Result: no HIGH or MEDIUM severity findings. One LOW, reachable only through the library
and not through the command line program.** A second LOW was raised and later withdrawn; the
section below says why, and the addendum records the correction.

## Why a second review was needed

Everything below the `Transport` trait was replaced. The earlier review could say nothing
about any of it:

- the dependency graph grew from one crate with a vendored C library to 28 crates of Rust,
  reaching IOKit through `objc2`
- the five second read timeout is now a race between the read and a timer, which means a
  future is dropped while it holds a mutable borrow of the answer buffer
- the leading report id byte is no longer prepended by this program
- the build resolved `async-hid` to a patched local checkout rather than to crates.io

## Attack surface examined

| Category | Finding |
|---|---|
| Command injection | no `std::process::Command` in production code; only in `tests/cli.rs`, with `CARGO_BIN_EXE_*` and fixed arguments |
| Path traversal, file access | no file operations at all; `Path` is used solely for the basename of `argv[0]` (`src/main.rs`) |
| Deserialisation, templating, XXE, SQL | not applicable - no parser and no serialisation format anywhere in the tree |
| Secrets, crypto | no keys, tokens or crypto calls; only the constants VID `0x04D8` and PID `0xF11B` |
| Format string injection | every `format!` and `writeln!` uses a literal with the values as arguments, which is not injectable by construction |
| `unsafe` in this program | none |
| `unsafe` in the dependency | 27 sites in the IOKit backend of `async-hid`, all of them FFI; the local patch adds one `unsafe impl Send` for a device handle moved into a dispatch block |
| Panics in production code | none reachable. `src/main.rs:95` is an `unreachable!` that `run()` guards by handling `Help`, `Version` and `List` before a board is opened; `src/fake.rs:72` sits behind the `fake` feature, which the shipped library does not enable |
| Test suite | 100 tests pass, 9 are ignored for want of a board |

## Focus: the new transport

### Cancelling a read is safe by construction

`Board::transfer` (`src/device.rs`) races `read_input_report(&mut resp)` against a timer and
drops whichever loses. That is the shape in which a use-after-free would live, if the
library handed the caller's buffer to the operating system and let IOKit write into it after
the future was gone.

It does not. `ReaderState::read` is a `poll_fn` that takes a finished report out of an
internally owned queue and copies it into the caller's buffer inside the poll
(`read_writer.rs`). IOKit writes only into buffers the library owns, registered once at open
time. A dropped read therefore leaves nothing pointing at `resp`, and the borrow ends with
the future.

### The write no longer hands out a pointer either

The published `async-hid` 0.5.3 passes the caller's buffer to
`IOHIDDeviceSetReportWithCallback` and returns; if that future is dropped before the
callback fires, IOKit is left holding a pointer into a buffer that may be gone. The local
patch (`e0aec7b`) replaces it with the synchronous `IOHIDDeviceSetReport` on a global
dispatch queue and copies the report into the block. That closes the hole, and it is the
reason this build must not fall back to the released crate.

### What a hostile board can put in an answer

Unchanged in substance from the earlier review, and re-checked against the current code:

- `Report` is a fixed `[u8; 64]`, freshly zeroed per exchange, so nothing leaks between
  commands
- a short read is rejected rather than interpreted (`Truncated answer from the board`),
  which the earlier transport could not distinguish
- the one length the device controls is now *rejected* when it exceeds the request rather
  than clamped: `i2c_read` refuses a reported count above the requested one, and the slice
  `resp[3..3 + reported]` has 63 as its highest index in a 64 byte buffer
- every other access to an answer is at a constant index inside the buffer

## Findings

### LOW 1 - WITHDRAWN: a device that publishes no maximum input report size

This was raised on the strength of `.expect("Device is not readable")` in
`read_input_report` (`read_writer.rs`), reading it as a panic a malformed device could
provoke. Following the open path afterwards showed that it cannot be reached, and the
finding does not stand:

- when the device does not publish `kIOHIDMaxInputReportSizeKey` and a readable handle was
  asked for, `DeviceReadWriter::new` closes the device and returns
  `HidError::message("Failed to read input report size")`. That is a handled error at open
  time, not a panic at read time
- `read_state` is `None` only for a handle opened write-only, and `open()` then hands out no
  reader at all: `read.then_some(rw.clone())`
- the public API cannot conflate the two. `DeviceReader`, `DeviceWriter` and
  `DeviceReaderWriter` are separate types, and `DeviceWriter` does not implement
  `AsyncHidRead`

The assertion guards an invariant the type system already enforces, which is what an
assertion is for. Recorded rather than deleted because a withdrawn finding is part of what a
review found.

### LOW - an answer that arrives after the timeout can be read as the answer to the next command

When the timer wins the race, the report that was in flight is not consumed: it stays in the
queue inside the library, and the next `transfer` pops it. The following command would then
read the previous command's answer.

The switching and configuration commands check only `resp[0] == op::ACK` (`request_acked`),
deliberately, because their answers beyond the status byte are undocumented. A stale ACK
passes that check, so such a command could report success without the board having acted on
it. Commands that decode data - port status, GPIO reads, versions, I2C - validate the echoed
opcode and would reject it.

**The command line program cannot reach this.** One invocation opens a board, performs
exactly one exchange and exits; `src/main.rs:270,280` assert that count for every command.
A queued report dies with the handle. The exposure is to library consumers that hold one
`Ykush3` across several commands - a test rig, which is the case the transport was hardened
for in the first place. Draining the queue after an `Error::NoResponse`, or reopening the
handle, would close it.

## Observations below the reporting bar

1. **`sanitize()` covers control characters, not format characters.** `char::is_control()`
   is the Unicode `Cc` category, so it catches C0 and C1 escapes - which is what the
   function was written for and what its tests assert. Characters in `Cf`, notably the bidi
   overrides `U+202E` and `U+202D`, pass through into terminal output from a device serial
   number or from `argv`. They cannot drive a terminal, only reorder what it displays.
2. **There is no write timeout.** `send()` has none because the library offers none, as the
   code says. A device that stalls its endpoint blocks for as long as the operating system
   allows.
3. **Any local process can drive the board.** macOS hands a HID device to whoever opens it
   first, with no privilege required. A property of the platform and the device, not of this
   program, and unchanged since the earlier review.

## Supply chain

`cargo deny check` passes in full: advisories ok, bans ok, licenses ok, sources ok. The
graph resolves to 28 crates including this package, all under MIT, Apache-2.0 or - for
`unicode-ident`, through proc macros of the Windows crates this target never builds  - 
Unicode-3.0.

One gap is worth stating plainly. The build depends on `[patch.crates-io] async-hid = { path
= "../async-hid" }`, a sibling checkout that is not part of this repository: branch
`setreport-fix`, one commit `e0aec7b` on top of the released 0.5.3. A clone of this
repository on its own does not build - `cargo metadata` on a bare export fails with `failed
to load source for dependency async-hid`. So the artifact reviewed here is not the artifact
a third party can currently produce from the published sources, and anything that did
resolve `async-hid` from crates.io would get 0.5.3, with both the input-report stall and the
dropped-pointer hole described above. This closes when the fix is released upstream; until
then the patch should point at a git revision of the fork rather than at a path.

## Compared with the hidapi state

The position improved in three ways and became more dependent in one.

| | |
|---|---|
| No third party C is compiled or shipped any more | better |
| A dropped write no longer leaves IOKit holding a pointer into this program's memory | better - and it is a hole the released crate still has |
| A truncated answer is rejected instead of being read together with buffer padding | better |
| A stale-answer path now lives in code this project does not own | worse |

## Addendum - what was fixed afterwards

The findings above describe the state at the time of the review. All three were acted on
the same day; the sections are left as they were written.

**LOW 1 was withdrawn, not fixed.** It was first acted on by turning both assertions into
returned errors. Checking the open path afterwards showed there is nothing to fix: the
missing-property case already errors at open time, and a handle without a reader is never
handed to a caller who could read from it. The change was dropped again rather than left in
as defensive code for a state that cannot occur. The finding section above carries the
reasoning.

**The remaining LOW is closed for the common case.** `Board` now carries a `stale` flag
(`src/device.rs`). A read that loses the race against the timer sets it, and the next
exchange empties the queue of the transport before sending, so an answer that arrived late
is dropped instead of being read as the answer to the following command. The drain is
bounded twice, by a 50 ms wait and by 16 reports, so neither a silent board nor one that
streams can hold the program in it.

What remains: an answer that arrives *after* the drain and before the real one is still
ambiguous, because the protocol carries no correlation id and the switching commands answer
with nothing beyond the status byte. Closing that would take either a board that echoes its
opcode on those commands - which has not been observed - or reopening the handle after every
timeout. The window is now the length of one exchange rather than unbounded.

The drain has no automated test. Provoking it needs a board that answers late, which no fake
can stand in for and no healthy device does.

**The sanitiser now covers format characters too.** `sanitize()` replaced the `Cc` category
and nothing else, so the bidirectional overrides and the zero width characters reached the
terminal. They cannot drive it, but `U+202E` reorders the rest of the line and `U+200B` and
its neighbours print as nothing, which is enough to display one board's serial number as
another's. Both groups are replaced now, with two tests naming what each one could have
done. `U+FFFD` is still kept, so a lossy `argv` conversion still shows where the bad byte
was.

**The supply chain gap is closed.** `[patch.crates-io]` pointing at `../async-hid` is gone.
`async-hid` is an ordinary git dependency now, pinned by revision to the fork, and
`Cargo.lock` records which one. The revision has moved since this was written, when
sidit77/async-hid#50 was merged and the branch rebased onto it; the tree did not change. A copy of this repository with no sibling directory builds, passes
the suite and drives a board, which is what the review found it could not do. The pin is
itself temporary: it goes away when the fix is released on crates.io.

## Scope

A snapshot of the commit named above, with the dependency as the patch resolves it today.
Changes made afterwards are not covered. A review with no finding above LOW is no proof of
correctness - it says that nothing more was found in the categories examined.
