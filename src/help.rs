Ports. The number 4 addresses the separate 5V output, the letter a every
downstream port at once.

  -u PORT            power the port up            PORT = 1|2|3|4|a
  -d PORT            power the port down          PORT = 1|2|3|4|a
  -g PORT            report whether it is on      PORT = 1|2|3|4
  -on                shorthand for -u 4
  -off               shorthand for -d 4
  -c PORT STATE      what the port does after a reset or a power cut:
                     0 stay off, 1 come up, 2 return to where it was.
                     PORT = 1|2|3|e, where e is the 5V output

GPIO. Three pins, driven from the host once the control interface is off.

  -r PIN             read the pin and print 0 or 1     PIN = 1|2|3
  -w PIN LEVEL       drive the pin high or low         LEVEL = 0|1
  --gpio enable      hand the pins over to the board, which then switches
                     the like-numbered port according to the level it sees
  --gpio disable     take the pins back for -r and -w

I2C. Enabling either mode makes the board re-enumerate; it stays enabled
across resets and power cuts. Addresses are hexadecimal, 7 bit, aligned to
the top of the byte: write 0xA2 for address 0x51.

  --i2c-slave enable|disable    let an outside master switch the ports
  --i2c-master enable|disable   let this host reach devices on the bus
  --i2c-set-address ADDR        the address the board answers to as a slave
  --i2c-write ADDR BYTE...      put bytes on the bus, at most 60
  --i2c-read ADDR COUNT         take bytes off the bus, at most 60,
                                one per line as a decimal number

Board.

  -l                 list the serial number of every attached board
  -s SERIAL          send the command to that board rather than to the
                     first one the system enumerates
  --firmware-version, --bootloader-version
  --reset            restart the board
  --boot             stop in the bootloader, ready for a firmware image
  -v, --version      print the version of this program
  -h, --help         print this text

Exit status is 0 when the command went through and 1 when it did not.
