# Reporting a vulnerability

Report privately to the maintainer, Gerhard Schuster
<gerhard.schuster@44qm.net>, rather than opening a public issue. That address is
the one in the commit history, so it is not new information.

Say what the program does wrong and how to bring it about. A patch is welcome but
not expected. Expect an answer within a week; if none arrives, the report has gone
astray and is worth sending again.

Only the current state of the default branch is maintained. There are no
supported older releases to backport a fix to.

## What is in scope

This program talks to one USB device and prints what it says. The interesting
boundary is what comes back from that device: it is not trusted, and anything
that makes the program mishandle a hostile or broken board is in scope. So is
anything reachable through the command line.

Out of scope, because they are properties of the hardware rather than of this
program:

- that any local process can open the device and switch ports or drop the board
  into its bootloader — macOS grants HID devices to whoever asks first, and this
  program neither adds nor could add a check there
- firmware behaviour of the board itself, which belongs to Yepkit
- denial of service by holding the device open; the operating system hands it out
  exclusively and only one program can have it at a time

## What has already been looked at

[SECURITY-REVIEW.md](SECURITY-REVIEW.md) records a review of the trust boundary
to the device, the command line, and the dependency surface. Note who wrote it:
the author of the code, not an outside party. It is a record of what was
examined, not an independent audit.
